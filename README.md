# messenger_app
* | A simple C++ messenger app using MySQL Workbench and native C++.

* | Remember to have linked all MySQL dependencies (c++ connector, community server with folders lib & include and .libs)

* | The code to stablish a connexion to the database was removed for security, instead, you have a .exe with all good. Theres some easy errors to solve like chat that are not searching for cin new messages while showing the cat.
